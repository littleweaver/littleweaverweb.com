<strong class="co-name">Little Weaver Web Collective</strong> is a full-service web application development group. We do design, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Django-based backends. We take on both new development projects and maintenance of existing projects.

Our collective skills include:

* Web and Print Design
* HTML5
* CSS with Compass and SASS
* Javascript with jQuery
* Django and Python
* Debian and Ubuntu server administration

In addition to our client work, we also produce open-source applications and libraries such as [Django Daguerre](http://django-daguerre.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
