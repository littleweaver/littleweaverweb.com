We're hosting the first ever **Dancerfly Sprint** on **September 12, 2015**. We will be working all day to make Dancerfly better. If you like dance events and the web, we'd love to have you join us! There's lots to do. This will be a great time for:

* **dance organizers and attendees** to give us feedback, suggestions, and ideas in _real-time as we code_.
* **designers and UI/UX experts and amateurs** to contribute design concepts to a growing open-source project.
* **aspiring coders** to cut their teeth on a fully functional web application, contribute to an open-source project, and get feedback on their code.
* **experienced coders** to help make life easier for dance event organizers!

Do it to make the world better, to sharpen your skills, and to gain fame and glory! There may even be prizes!

## Quick details

* Saturday, September 12, 1â€“5PM ET
* [GitHub Repository][on github]
* [Gitter.im Discussion Channel](https://gitter.im/littleweaver/django-brambling)

## What is a sprint?

A sprint is an excuse for us to focus our undivided attention on improving Dancerfly and we're inviting you to join us! Anybody who has any experience with dance events can contribute: ideas, feedback, design, and code.

It's a great opportunity to make Dancerfly better, to get your name in an open-source project, and to get experience working on a software project with the support of experienced developers. It's also going to be a lot of fun.

## How to participate

1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub account, if you don't already have one.
2. [Join the chat][on gitter] at Gitter.im. Our sprint doesn't have a physical location, but we've got a virtual table to sit around.
3. Check out specific instructions for different types of participation below.

Contributing to Dancerfly can be done at _any time_ but we'll be available and actively working on it together during the sprint hours.

## Participate in creating issues, giving feedback, and generating ideas

We keep track of bugs and suggestions in [GitHub Issues][github issues]. Browse our [current issue list][github issues], add comments and ideas, and create new issues for your own ideas. Issues labelled as [design decision needed](https://github.com/littleweaver/django-brambling/labels/design%20decision%20needed) are particularly in need of people who want to look over and discuss the best solutions.

If you want to play around with Dancerfly to get ideas or test things, feel free to noodle around on [Dancerfly.com][dancerfly]. If you need to see how an event works, use the [demo event](https://dancerfly.com/demo/demo-event/). You can safely complete an entire purchase on the demo event without triggering any _real_ financial transactions.

Always feel free to use the [Gitter channel][on gitter] to discuss anything.

## Participate in writing code

We recommend that you get a local development environment set up before the sprint so you can dive right into coding when we start.

Dancerfly uses GitHub/git for version control. It is written primarily in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Our frontend behavior is mostly [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), though we're working on adding more asynchronous functionality using [Ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org/). Our CSS is written as [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and compiled on-the-fly. If you're comfortable in these languages, you'll be comfortable with Dancerfly. (If not, this is great time to learn them!)

To get started developing in a local environment, we recommend creating your own fork of the Dancerfly code-base. (Dancerfly is called [`django-brambling`][on github] in its code, for historical reasons.)

Follow the instructions [in the README](https://github.com/littleweaver/django-brambling#installation-instructions) to set up a local development environment.

We keep track of bugs and suggestions in [GitHub Issues][github issues]. Browse the list and feel free to claim any issues you think you can tackle or create some issues of your own. Issues labelled [easy pickings](https://github.com/littleweaver/django-brambling/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22easy+pickings%22) are a particularly good place to get started. Let us know in [Gitter][on gitter] what you want to work on and we can give you more background information, suggestions on how to approach it, accolades for your heroism, etc.

Thanks for joining us! Let us know if you have any questions or concerns in the [Gitter channel][on gitter] or at [support@dancerfly.com](mailto:support@dancerfly.com)
