title:  Why we provided "Trad Blues" and "Alt Blues" options – and why we stopped

It isn't a new idea that the terms "Alt Blues" and "Trad Blues" shouldn't be used – that we should just call Blues "Blues" and everything else "Fusion". Most often, it's presented as a prescriptive rule: "We shouldn't call that blues because it isn't. This *is* blues and doesn't need a modifier."

While that's not wrong, it's also a pretty uncompelling argument, at least to me. If there's a large community of people dancing a dance and calling it a certain thing, it makes sense to acknowledge the existence of that dance and that name: "Alt Blues".

And there have been many times in my dance life when I've gone to a "Blues" event and found it to be "Alt Blues" – so I can very much appreciate having "Trad Blues" available to avoid ambiguity. This is especially relevent if you're thinking about a larger investment, like attending a workshop / exchange / recess weekend.

This is essentially why, when we launched [Dancerfly](https://dancerfly.com) in fall 2014, we provided "Trad Blues", "Alt Blues", and "Fusion" among the list of dance styles organizers could choose for their events.

But here's the thing. As uncompelling as the prescriptive argument may be, on a deeper level, this isn't just an intellectual argument about aesthetic. It's about cultural appropriation. Specifically, as [Damon Stone recently put it](http://damonstone.dance/articles/appreciation-versus-appropriation/) (paraphrased), the terms "Trad Blues" and "Alt Blues" take a touchstone of African-American culture – a Black dance idiom done to Black music rooted in African movement and rhythms and in the struggles and pain of Black Americans – and erase both its history and its current ongoing existence.

And this happens primarily for the pleasure and enjoyment of non-Black dancers, as part of a pattern of appropriation that's pervaded American culture for a long, long, time.

I find the cultural appropriation framing to be much more compelling than the prescriptive one. Honestly, though, it's not a new idea either. We at Little Weaver try to hold ourselves to a higher standard on issues like this, and in this case, **we made a mistake**. An organizer looking to use Dancerfly recently called us out on this, rightly, and we're grateful.

We've removed "Alt Blues" and "Trad Blues" as options, replacing them with "Blues" alone. Some time in the near future, we will be adding descriptions to the site of each dance style we support, so that attendees and organizers can be *sure* they're on the same page about what to expect from an event.
