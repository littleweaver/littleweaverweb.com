title:  Looking to Work With an Illustrator

We're looking for an illustration to give personality to [Dancerfly](http://dancerfly.com), our dance event registration service.

This is a small single-illustration job, but we're also looking for an artist with whom we'd enjoy collaborating more in the future.

## What we're looking for

### Uses

We're hoping to be able to use one illustration in a number of ways: 

- On a 940x300 pixel banner
- Across the bottom of a full-width header or footer
- Chopped up into components to be used across the site (say, a collection of dancers that can be used individually or together)
- On a business card

### Color

Do whatever you want. Don't take our current scheme into account because we're not sure we even like it. We're fine with full color, or a limited palette, or grayscale, or black and white, or whatever.

### Content

We have some ideas regarding content relating to our product and its current name, but we're interested in having a conversation with whatever artist we select about their ideas.

#### Dancers

- Preferably dance-style-non-specific or a variety of dance styles
- Not heteronormative or a collection of white people

#### Flight

- Some allusion to the idea of flight
- Could be wings or jet packs or whatever
- The name Dancerfly is a bit of a play on damselfly, but we want to keep in mind that some people don't like to look at pictures of bugs.

One idea we have is something with a row of dancers, maybe in different styles of dance, maybe different means of flight, maybe the dancers are various animals that can fly.

## Interested?

Send us a cost estimate and some art examples or a portfolio by Friday, February 6th. Nothing formal, just send a quick email to [hello@littleweaverweb.com](mailto:hello@littleweaverweb.com), and we'll be in touch.
