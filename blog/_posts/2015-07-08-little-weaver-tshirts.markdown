We wanted to make shirts even before we had a new logo. We didn't have plans about how to do it, but we thought it would be cute, and a good thing for marketing.

When we talked to [Lucy Bellwood]() about how we would be able to use the new logo she was designing for us, she mentioned that she knew someone who had used [TeeSpring](). Unlike conventional shirt printing companies, TeeSpring offers more flexibility than having you order a mass of shirts to be delivered to one place in one box. We were able to put up a design and let an indeterminate number of people order shirts in any size to wherever they might live—and price the shirts so we made a profit.

We selected three shirt styles in relatively similar colors. Harris and I really wanted long sleeved tees, because we both own fewer of those than we would like, but Stephen wanted a normal short sleeved shirt, so we offered a long sleeved, a boxy short-sleeved, and a fitted short-sleeved.

We considered selling the shirts at cost, but a quick informal poll of our friends showed that they were more interested in buying the shirts if they knew that we were getting some money from it. So we priced the shirts, whose cost was somewhere between $15 and $20 varying by style, each at $20. This way people didn't have to choose a style based on cost, and we made just enough money to cover buying one shirt for each of the three of us and one for Lucy.

One thing about using TeeSpring was that we didn't actually know who had ordered each of the 31 shirts we sold. We knew that we had bought 4, and my immediate family had bought 5… but we didn't know who all the rest of the people were. So we asked! And we got quite a few pictures of lovely people in lovely shirts, which we present to you below:

_PS: If you're sad that you didn't get a shirt the first time around, send us an email and we can re-launch... I know TeeSpring has a built-in way to do that, but I heard a request for tank tops._
