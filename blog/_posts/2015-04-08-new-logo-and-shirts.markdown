Little Weaver has a brand new logo, and we're selling T-shirts with that logo on them! The illustration for the logo was done by the fabulous Lucy Bellwood; you should check out some of her other work at [lucybellwood.com](http://lucybellwood.com/). Yes, now!

Weâ€™ll be making a little bit of money off of these sales, which will go toward building Little Weaver Web Collective into a stable cooperative business. Give us a hand and get a cool shirt in the process!
