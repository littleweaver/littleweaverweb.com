We're a small worker cooperative looking for people who do any of the following, for prospective part- or full-time membership.

* Graphic design, illustration, production
* QA and testing
* Project management
* Client acquisition and relations
* Business and accounting
* Programming. (Our focus is a Django / Python stack, but PHP knowledge is a bonus.)

#### You will like being a member of Little Weaver if...

* You like having equal pay and an equal say in all decisions
* You want to work remotely and have a flexible schedule
* You like web work but not the culture that tends to come with it
* You want the flexibility to choose to expand your skillset to include additional roles (or not)

#### You will not like working with us if...

* You are looking for us to provide a $75k+ salary right now
* You need us to provide health insurance right now (as opposed to purchasing insurance through an exchange)

Little Weaver is a young collective, but we're ready to grow. All of our members were recently able to transition to Little Weaver full-time, and there's still more work available to us than we're able to handle at our current scale.

If you're interested in working with us, send your resume and any relevant work to [hello@littleweaverweb.com](mailto:hello@littleweaverweb.com), along with a short paragraph about why you're interested in working with us (really, don't sweat it).
